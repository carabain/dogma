- Set an environment entry "NODE_INSTALL_DIR" which points tot the folder containing a "node" folder.
  e.g. set it to "C:\ws\apps" if the path to the node installation is "C:\ws\apps\node".
  (If you have a "nodejs" folder, rename it to "node". This is needed for the maven plugin to work correctly.)
